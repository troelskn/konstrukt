This is a default setup for a webapplication, using the Konstrukt framework.

You can copy the contents to a new location, to create a new web application. To make it reachable through a web server, you'll have to configure Apache (Currently the only server supported) to serve from the www folder.

This setup is a minimal configuration, having only Konstrukt as a runtime dependency. If you need a more complete environment, you should take a look at `starterpack_default` instead.

The following dependencies are required:
  Konstrukt, version 2 (http://konstrukt.googlecode.com/svn/trunk)
